# Proxmox

I downlaoded the latest version of Proxmox VE 8.4 and used the open source GUI utility balencaEtcher to flash it to a usb drive.

I am using an old De3ll Optiplex 9020 with an i7 and 16gb of ram and SSDF for my primary machine at the moemnt. I may add another dedicated serve later and keep this as a bakcup or part odf the cluster. I made sure to enabel UEFI boot and also enable all virtualiziont features and then proceeded to boot form the USB to isntall Proxmox.

THis is my first time using proxmox so I chose the GUI isntallationa dn let it go to work. 

For network I assinged it as static ip address of 192.168.100 and the proper dns and gateway address and set a hsotname as well. 

After the isntallation finished and the server rebooted, I was able to login formt he web interface on port 8006 to finihs ocnfiguring the server.
